# Discord Thread Auto-Lock Bot

## Overview

This is a Discord bot that automatically locks threads based on role permissions and provides options to delete locked threads. The bot is built with Python using discord.py library and follows a modular architecture with separate handlers for different functionalities.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Bot message style: Simple text messages with button options for thread management.
Auto-delete feature: Threads in specific channels automatically delete 5 seconds after locking.
UI Interface: Uses compact buttons (Delete/Keep) for thread options after locking.
24/7 Operation: Bot configured with keep-alive system and auto-restart for continuous operation.

## System Architecture

The bot follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Main Entry Point**: `main.py` - handles bot initialization and startup
- **Bot Core**: `bot.py` - main bot class with setup and event handling
- **Configuration Management**: `config.py` - handles loading and managing bot settings
- **Handler Modules**: Separate modules for specific functionalities
  - `handlers/thread_handler.py` - thread locking/unlocking operations
  - `handlers/permission_handler.py` - user permission validation
- **Utilities**: `utils/logger.py` - logging setup and thread action logging

## Key Components

### Bot Infrastructure
- **Discord.py Framework**: Uses commands.Bot as the base class with proper intents setup
- **Async/Await Pattern**: All Discord operations use async/await for non-blocking execution
- **Cog System**: Thread handler is implemented as a Discord.py cog for better organization

### Configuration System
- **JSON-based Config**: Uses `config.json` for persistent settings
- **Environment Variables**: Discord token stored securely in environment variables
- **Guild-specific Settings**: Supports different role configurations per Discord server
- **Default Fallbacks**: Provides sensible defaults if config file is missing or corrupted

### Permission Management
- **Multi-level Authorization**: Checks administrator permissions, manage_threads permission, and custom role names/IDs
- **Role-based Access**: Configurable authorized roles per guild
- **Debug Logging**: Comprehensive logging of permission checks for troubleshooting

### Thread Operations
- **Auto-lock Triggers**: Responds to specific commands ("lock", "lna") in thread messages
- **Interactive UI**: Uses Discord UI components (buttons) for delete confirmation
- **User Validation**: Ensures only the locking moderator can delete threads

## Data Flow

1. **Message Processing**: Bot receives messages and checks if they contain lock commands
2. **Permission Validation**: Checks if the user has required permissions through PermissionHandler
3. **Thread Locking**: Locks the thread and creates delete confirmation UI
4. **Action Logging**: All actions are logged with timestamps and user information
5. **Optional Deletion**: Moderator can choose to delete the locked thread via button interaction

## External Dependencies

### Python Packages
- **discord.py**: Main Discord API wrapper for bot functionality
- **python-dotenv**: Environment variable management for secure token storage
- **asyncio**: Built-in async support for Discord operations
- **json**: Built-in JSON parsing for configuration management
- **logging**: Built-in logging for debugging and action tracking

### Discord API Features
- **Message Content Intent**: Required to read message content for lock commands
- **Guilds Intent**: Access to server information and roles
- **Members Intent**: Access to member information and role checking
- **Slash Commands**: Modern Discord command interface
- **UI Components**: Buttons and interactive elements for user actions

## Deployment Strategy

### Environment Setup
- **Python 3.8+**: Minimum Python version requirement
- **Virtual Environment**: Recommended for dependency isolation
- **Environment Variables**: Uses `.env` file for Discord token storage

### Configuration Requirements
- **Discord Bot Token**: Required environment variable `DISCORD_TOKEN`
- **Bot Permissions**: Needs "Manage Threads" and "Send Messages" permissions in Discord
- **Role Configuration**: Customizable through `config.json` for different servers

### Logging and Monitoring
- **File Logging**: Creates `logs/` directory with persistent log files
- **Console Output**: Real-time logging to terminal/console
- **Action Tracking**: Dedicated logging for all thread lock/unlock/delete operations
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching with informative log messages

### Scalability Considerations
- **Guild-specific Config**: Supports multiple Discord servers with different settings
- **Role ID Support**: Fallback to role IDs for servers where role names might change
- **Async Operations**: Non-blocking design allows handling multiple threads simultaneously
